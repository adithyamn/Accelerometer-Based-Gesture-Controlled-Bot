# Accelerometer-Based-Gesture-Controlled-Bot
This robot moves in different directions when the remote(which consists of the accelerometer) is tilted. This Robot uses 2 CC2500 modules, one in a remote and other in the robot to transcieve data. The data is processed by an ATmega16 and and the motor moves in the corresponding direction.
